Open the JAR, no need to download the code or anything for it to run, 
all the code is there tho incase you want to edit yourself or just want to check there arent any weird stuff
Input your X and Z coordinates of your known stronghold, it will calculate based on [0, Y, 0] and your current coords and triangulate an aprox
Really all it does is just get the angle of the thing, make a circle using your current point as the Radius from 0,0
then just moves the angle the x amount of times based on the current circle
